# Dotfiles

The goal of this repo is to backup and version my config files and to provide some tools and documentation for getting a new machine setup with my desired work environment.

I used the approach documented here to set up this repo: https://www.anand-iyer.com/blog/2018/a-simpler-way-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html
